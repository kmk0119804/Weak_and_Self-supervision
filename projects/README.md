# Projects

Project-specific configurations and experiments.

## Purpose

This folder is designed for:
- Different project variants
- Experimental configurations
- Custom domain adaptations
- Alternative approaches

## Planned Structure

```
projects/
├── construction_safety/    # Current project
├── traffic_monitoring/     # Future extension
└── industrial_inspection/  # Future extension
```

## Use Cases

Each project subfolder may contain:
- Custom data configurations
- Domain-specific preprocessing
- Specialized model settings
- Project-specific scripts

## Current Implementation

The main implementation is directly in the root-level modules:
- `segment-anything/`
- `yolo-V8/`
