# Configs

Centralized configuration files for the project.

## Purpose

This folder is reserved for:
- Unified YAML configuration files
- Hyperparameter settings
- Dataset path configurations
- Training parameter presets

## Current Status

Configuration files are currently located in their respective stage folders:
- `yolo-V8/baseline/data.yaml`
- `yolo-V8/weak-supervision/weak_data.yaml`
- `yolo-V8/self-training/self_data.yaml`

## Future Plans

May consolidate all configs here for easier management and experimentation.

**Status:** Placeholder - configs currently in stage folders
